# Blue Archive Linux

*A lightweight, Blue Archive-themed Linux distribution for fans and enthusiasts.*

## Overview

Blue Archive Linux, created by **minhmc2007**, is a custom Linux distribution inspired by the vibrant world of *Blue Archive*. Built on Arch Linux, it delivers a rolling-release system with a unique, themed experience tailored for fans of the game, blending aesthetics with practical innovation.

## Features

- **Custom SDDM Theme**: A *Blue Archive*-inspired login screen for a stylish boot experience.
- **GNOME with Blue Archive Wallpaper**: GNOME desktop environment, with custom *Blue Archive* wallpapers in development.
- **Sensei Default User**: Preconfigured user “Sensei” with password “sensei” for instant immersion.
- **bluefetch**: A Neofetch replacement using `w3m` to render images in the terminal, built from scratch since Neofetch is discontinued.
- **bluepm**: A custom, ultra-fast package manager exclusive to this distro—simply copies and recompiles binaries for speed.

## Installation

Currently, there is no automated installer for Blue Archive Linux. This project is a work in progress, and installation requires manually building it on an existing Arch Linux system. Check the repository files for configurations and scripts to apply the customizations yourself.

## Technologies Used

- **Linux Kernel**: The foundation of the distribution.
- **Arch Linux**: Rolling-release base for cutting-edge software.
- **GNOME**: Desktop environment with planned *Blue Archive* theming.
